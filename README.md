## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

a. Instructions on how to build the project. flutter build appbundle or ipa

b. Adapted design pattern for the app architecture with justification on why to
choose it. MVVM more readable

c. Adapted image loader library with justification on why to choose it. cach network image to make not reload it every time and this will damage preformance

d. Used database in the app with justification on why to choose it. hive storage because it is the fastest storage and secure
